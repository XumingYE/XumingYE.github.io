I'm a third year graduate student from [Minzu University of China (985, 211 project)](https://www.muc.edu.cn/), and graduated from [University of South China](https://www.usc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes storage system, cloud computing, big data, deep learning, etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Weng](https://gjaqyjy.muc.edu.cn/info/1052/1171.htm) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/). I was advised by [Prof. Tian](https://tianwenlong001.github.io/wenlongtian/) from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/).

You can find my CV here: [CV](../files/cv-申博简历.pdf).

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
